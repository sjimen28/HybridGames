We would like to thank all of the reviewers for the comments.

- Concern about the discussion of the extension of the parameter values initialization by Reviewers 1, 2 and 4

In each file, we have included a heading listing the parameters defined in the initialization section. Each of these parameters is introduced and can be modified in the corresponding subsection, namely, continuous dynamics, discrete dynamics, value function, or initial condition.
This allows to simulate new systems with pure continuous, pure discrete or hybrid behaviors.

We have addressed the typo and errors encountered by Reviewer 4 when modifying the initial conditions. Some properties of the appearance of the figures (i.e., ticks and axes sizes) will only be preserved for the current system. If interested in maintaining them for a new system, specify according to the new requirements.



- Regarding the configure_toolbox command by Reviewer 2

The configure_toolbox command is a sanity check. The reader will be able to run the entire simulation simply by following the prompt steps in the readme file, without running this command. 

We would like to thank all of the reviewers for the valuable feedback.
